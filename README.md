# ESP32 Button Press Toggle

This repository contains an Arduino sketch for an ESP32 microcontroller. The code monitors an input pin for button presses and toggles the state of a digital output pin. It is designed for use with Arduino IDE or PlatformIO.

## Description

This Arduino sketch utilizes an ESP32 microcontroller to monitor a specific input pin (pin 34) for button presses. When a button press is detected, the code toggles the state of an output pin (pin 2) and prints a message to the serial monitor.

## Requirements

To use this code, you'll need the following:

- An ESP32 microcontroller
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- USB drivers for the ESP32 board
- A button or switch connected to pin 34
- A serial connection to monitor output (baud rate: 115200)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local development environment:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JoaoBarioni/Test-FCF-input
